kali sources
The official Kali Linux repository should look something like this:

If it’s missing, add it by editing the sources.list file using a text editor like Nano:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the correct repository lines then save the file and exit.

wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | apt-key add
